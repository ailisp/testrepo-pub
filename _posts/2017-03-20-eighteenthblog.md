    <td>Social Media is computer-mediated technology that allow the creating and sharing of information, ideas and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduce the challenges of defining. However, there are more things than you would expect and some which you would not class as a form of Social Media when they actually are. </td>

    <th>How Social Media Impacts My Life</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Social Media impacts my life by letting me know what my friends are up to all the time, whilst also letting them know the joys and pleasure of my own life. It also can let me know information and new that is interesting to myself, however there can be a lot of fake news posted on there, which can be misleading. In general, I find it good because it is a good way to easily communicate with friends.</td>

  <th>What we discussed today</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>We discussed about religion and how it impacts people's lives. It makes them feel like they are always suported and it makes them feel as if they have been told their value and addition to life. Mr Keen also discussed with us about lies to try and make our lives simpler or to bring an element of joy to them. As an example, when Mr Keen told us about how he lies to his daughter about when the ice-cream vans play the music it means that they have ran out of ice-cream and they are on their way back home - this is a lie to simplay make our lives easier. However, a lie to bring more of a joy to life, are things like the 'Easter Bunny', making people find the joy of the chocolate eggs that the 'Easter Bunny' has hidden around you back garden.</td>
