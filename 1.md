# asd-generator
Automatic generator for ASDF's .asd files.

This is still in alpha, but I use it to build my own projects, if it means anything. `:P`


This autoregenerates an .asd file with a customizable `:COMPONENTS` field, based on the file structure you provide.

The project must have a valid `.asd` file containing a single `asdf:defsystem` expression.

The project must have a `asd-generator-data.asd` file with the structure outlined below.
